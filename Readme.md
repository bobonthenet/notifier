# Notifier

This is a very simple notification app that runs in a loop. I've put very little effort into this and will probably not develop it any further because it already does what I want and I don't mind just editing the code for each use case. It uses https://github.com/mikaelbr/node-notifier to do the notifications.

```JavaScript
git clone https://github.com/bobonthenet/notifier.git
cd notifier
npm install
node notify.js
```
